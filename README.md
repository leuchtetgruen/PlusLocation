# PlusLocation
An offline navigator that uses PlusCodes


PlusLocation is an app that helps you navigate from A to B using a simple compass and distance based interface. It uses PlusCodes (also known as OpenLocationCodes) instead of adresses to refer to places. 

It can also import a database of places to let you search for locations of which you dont know the PlusCode. The app also shows popular places near your target location to give you a better understanding of where you have to go.

All of this works offline without any internet connection.
